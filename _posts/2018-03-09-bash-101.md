# Bash 101

## Inspiration and Attribution

I've written some bash over the years. I'm a big fan of building out robust [.bash_profile](https://wyattandersen.com/development/2015/09/23/a-modular-self-managed-bash-profile.html)s, but I've always just "hacked" on Bash. I'd try writing some logic three or four[1] times until I found the syntax that "worked." I've read tutorials, documentation, and blog posts on bash, but I've never "[grokked it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grok)."

Then, at MidwestPHP 2018 I got to attend a talk titled "BASHing at the CLI." It was given by [Chris Tankersley](http://ctankersley.com/), [@dragonmantank](https://twitter.com/dragonmantank) on Twitter.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m learning more about coding in BASH in <a href="https://twitter.com/dragonmantank?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dragonmantank</a> &#39;s &quot;BASHing at the CLI&quot; talk at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mwphp18?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mwphp18</a> than in several years of studying it on my own. O.o <br><br>Very cool. <a href="https://t.co/FmXh5FcXfu">pic.twitter.com/FmXh5FcXfu</a></p>&mdash; Wyatt Andersen (@wandersen02) <a href="https://twitter.com/wandersen02/status/972151050269548544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 9, 2018</a></blockquote>

That was a great talk. I learned a lot, and immediately after I sat down at my Mac to work through the things I learned.

What follows is a poor substitute for Tankersley's talk (and his expertise), but I wanted to get it written down, if only to help me absorb.

### Shameless Plug

[MidwestPHP](https://2018.midwestphp.org/) is a great conference. If you have any interest in PHP, and live, or want to travel to the "midwest" (or the "North" as I think we're supposed to call it now...) - you should come!

I'm one of the organizers, and have been for years, so I'm _maybe_ a little bias. But... Still:

Go to MidwestPHP.

## Bash

### What is Bash?

> "Bash is the GNU Project's shell. Bash is the Bourne Again SHell. Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh). It is intended to conform to the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard. It offers functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without modification." - [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

Bash is a low level language that interfaces directly with other Unix utilities. It's commonly used in ops because most Unix systems can run it without having to install any external dependancies. It's also commonly used in .bash_profiles to construct utilities like:

```
#!/usr/bash
rebase () {
  git checkout master   
  git pull origin master  
  git checkout $1  
  git pull --rebase origin master  
  git rebase -i `git merge-base $1 master`  
}
```

### What do I need to know first?

#### Shebang

A bash script start's with a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)), and the path to the bash executable you mean to use:

```
#!/usr/bash
```

#### Bash is Inconsistent

An `if` statement ends with `fi`, a `case` statement ends with `esac` ("if" and "case" backwards). But a `for` loop ends with `done` not `rof`.

#### Spaces Matter

`foo="bar"` is valid Bash. `foo = "bar"` will not do what you think it will:

```
#!/usr/bash
foo = "bar"

...

> # terminal
> bash foo.sh
foo.sh: line 2: foo: command not found
```

Spaces also matter in `if` statements. `if [ 0 -eq 1 ]; then` is valid Bash, `if [0 -eq 1]; then` will not work like you think it will:

```
#!/usr/bash
if [0 -eq 1]; then
  echo "bar"
fi

...

> bash foo.sh
foo.sh: line 2: [0: command not found
```

#### Variables are Global by Default

Variables are global unless explicitly set to be `local`.

```
#!/bin/bash
function foo()
{
  BAR="baz"
}
foo
function fizz()
{
  local BUZZ="fizzbuzz"
}
foo

...

> bash foo.sh
baz

# ^ note the empty line above where "fizzbuzz" isn't
```

#### Functions Don't Have Defined Parameters

You don't get to do `function foo(variable_1, variable_2)` in Bash. Your function can still take parameters, just not with a method signature.

```
#!/bin/bash
function foo()
{
  echo "${1}"
}
foo Hello World
foo "Hello World"
...

> # terminal
> bash foo.sh
Hello
Hello World
```

#### Exiting

All bash scripts should `exit` with a integer. By convention and expectation `0` is "success" - `200 OK`-esque.

```
exit 0
```

You may define any other integer to convey other meanings as appropriate, `exit 1` is a conventional "error" - `500 Error`-esque.

### Bash 101
```
#!/bin/bash

echo "[1. echo]"
echo "Hello World"

GREETING="Hello World"
echo "[2. variable]"
echo "${GREETING}"

echo "[3. function]"
function say_hello()
{
  echo "${GREETING}"
}
say_hello

echo "[4. function with parameters]"
function say()
{
  echo "${1}"  
}
say "${GREETING}"

GREETING_ARRAY=(
  "Hello"  
  "World"
)
echo "[5. arrays]"
for WORD in "${GREETING_ARRAY[@]}"
do
  echo "${WORD}"
done

echo "[6. associative arrays]"
declare -a MESSAGE_HASH
MESSAGE_HASH[greeting]="${GREETING}"
echo "${MESSAGE_HASH[greeting]}"

echo "[7. while]"
COUNTER=0
while [ $COUNTER -le 1 ]
do
  echo "${GREETING_ARRAY[${COUNTER}]}"
  ((COUNTER++))
done

echo "[8. if/else]"
if [ 0 -eq 1 ]; then
  echo "If..."
elif [ "a" == "a" ]; then
  echo "${GREETING}"
else
  echo "Else..."
fi

echo "[9. executing a utility]"
FILE_MESSAGE=$(cat hello_world.txt)
echo "${FILE_MESSAGE}"

echo "[10. using an external file]"
source external_file.sh
external_greeting

exit 0
```
