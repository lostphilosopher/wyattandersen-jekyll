		<strong>About me: </strong>
		<p>I'm a Minneapolis based Software Engineer and consultant. I work for Optum Technology
      building a suite of developer ecosystem products including full monolithic Rails applications,
      API microservices with "serverless UI" React front ends, and a quite few things in between. I lead a
      team of talented engineers. Together we're taking on Kafka Event Driven Architecture, self service API
      Management, and building mission critical healthcare APIs serving thousands of requests per minute.
    </p>
    <p> I've worked at the intersection of health care, policy, and technology since I began my career.
      My experience includes start ups, innovation incubators, non profits, and Fortune 10 companies. I care about
      building the right thing and building the right thing well. As an engineering lead it is my goal to empower
      my team and to create and defend the environment they need to deliver tangible results.
    </p>
    <p> As a consultant I serve in one of two roles. I either operate as a catalyst taking a client's business to the next level
      by highlighting market and tech opportunities and pointing the way to next steps. Or, I oporate as a spark - getting an
      idea from hypothetical to revenue generating MVP in the shortest time possible. Either way - I move according to the principles
      of Lean Startup.
    </p>

		  Before I started coding I was a double major in Physics and Philosophy
